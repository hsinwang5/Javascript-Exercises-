# Learning-Web-App-Development---Sammy-Purewal
Book contains full Jquery code - refactor into vanilla Javascript

- This repository contains code from the book "Learning Web App Development" by Semmy Purewal. Most of the code is written in Jquery. The code is refactored into javascript except for certain situations where it is overly inefficient to use vanilla JS (at least in terms of human labor-hours, not actual cpu or algorithmic efficiency).
- The primary purpose of the refactor is for the purpose of learning vanilla javascript only, and the code should be taken as such.
