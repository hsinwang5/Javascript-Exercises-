Javascript Exercises


- This repository contains code and exercises from various books and manuals. Most of the code is written in vanilla Javascript with some Jquery where it makes sense. 
- The primary purpose of the cases where original Jquery code is refactored into Javascript is for learning vanilla javascript only, and the code should be taken as such. 
- If the code was written by someone else, it will be stated in // comments at the top, as well as the extent of modification
