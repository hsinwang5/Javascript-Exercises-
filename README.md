Javascript Exercises
Book contains full Jquery code - refactor into vanilla Javascript

- This repository contains code and exercises from various books and manuals. Most of the code is written in Jquery and vanilla Javascript. The code is refactored into javascript except for certain situations where it is overly inefficient to use vanilla JS (at least in terms of human labor-hours, not actual cpu or algorithmic efficiency).
- The primary purpose of the refactor is for learning vanilla javascript only, and the code should be taken as such.
