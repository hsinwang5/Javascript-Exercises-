Allows a user to input a search term to retrieve recently uploaded images by tag. If the user likes an image, they can click+drag the image over to a clipboard to pin it up permanently. The original img disppears but they can still search for more pictures and drag those in too. 

**todo: improve site with some more advanced CSS
**todo: Add options for stop and image scroll interval for the user (done!)
**todo: add detection for overflow so images don't go out of bounds of the clipboard. (done!)
**todo: make clipboard scale in size to size of browser window (This would also introduce the problem of having to detect whether the resize causes an overflow since the overflow check is only done on-drop.
